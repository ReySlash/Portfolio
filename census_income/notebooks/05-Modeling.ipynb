    "# Introduction to Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the focus shifts to the modeling phase of the analysis, where various machine learning algorithms will be employed to predict income levels based on the preprocessed dataset. The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of different models in accurately classifying individuals into income categories (<=50K or >50K).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - Three distinct algorithms will be explored: \n",
    "     - Logistic Regression\n",
    "     - Decision Trees\n",
    "     - Random Forests\n",
    "   Each model brings its strengths and weaknesses, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - The models will be assessed using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This evaluation will help identify the best-performing model for predicting income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   - For the models that benefit from it, hyperparameter tuning will be conducted to optimize performance and enhance model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison of Results**:\n",
    "   - A comparative analysis of the models' performances will be conducted to draw insights on which algorithm is most effective for this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modeling phase aims to leverage the cleaned and processed data to develop predictive insights into income levels, ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of understanding income determinants in the dataset.\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, various modeling techniques were implemented to predict the income class based on demographic and employment features from the dataset. The following key steps were undertaken:\n",
    "\n",
    " **Random Forest Optimization**: \n",
    "   - The **Random Forest** model exhibited superior performance compared to the other models. To further enhance its predictive capability, a systematic hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Grid Search.\n",
    "   - A parameter grid was defined, exploring various values for hyperparameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, and `min_samples_leaf`.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - The best hyperparameters were identified through cross-validation, and the model was evaluated on both training and testing datasets.\n",
    "   - Key performance metrics, including accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports, were generated to assess the model’s effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    " **ROC AUC Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - The model's performance was further evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, providing insights into the trade-offs between true positive rates and false positive rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Final Evaluation Metrics Commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "   - The best hyperparameters identified through Grid Search are `max_depth: 21`, `min_samples_leaf: 1`, `min_samples_split: 4`, and `n_estimators: 23`. These values suggest a moderately deep tree with flexibility in splitting while maintaining a reasonable number of trees, which can help balance bias and variance in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy Scores**:\n",
    "   - The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy score of **0.8590** on the training set and **0.8564** on the test set. This indicates that the model performs consistently well across both datasets, suggesting it is neither overfitting nor underfitting significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confusion Matrix**:\n",
    "   - The confusion matrix reveals that the model made **5383 true negatives** (correctly predicted income ≤50K), **1075 true positives** (correctly predicted income >50K), **782 false negatives** (predicted ≤50K but actual >50K), and **301 false positives** (predicted >50K but actual ≤50K). \n",
    "   - The model performs well in identifying the majority class (income ≤50K) but has a higher number of false negatives for the minority class (income >50K), indicating room for improvement in detecting positive cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Classification Report**:\n",
    "   - The precision for class **0** (income ≤50K) is **0.87**, while for class **1** (income >50K), it is **0.78**. This shows that the model is more reliable in predicting the majority class than the minority class. \n",
    "   - The recall for class **0** is **0.95**, which is excellent, indicating that the model captures most of the true instances of income ≤50K. However, the recall for class **1** is only **0.58**, indicating that a significant portion of the actual positive instances is being missed.\n",
    "   - The **F1-score** for class **1** is **0.67**, which is a balanced measure of precision and recall, but it highlights that there is still a need to improve the detection of the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Macro and Weighted Averages**:\n",
    "   - The macro average precision of **0.83**, recall of **0.76**, and F1-score of **0.79** indicate a general performance level across both classes, treating them equally regardless of their support.\n",
    "   - The weighted average scores (precision **0.85**, recall **0.86**, F1-score **0.85**) reflect the model's performance considering the imbalance in class distribution, providing a more representative view of model performance in a real-world context.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **AUC Score**:\n",
    "   - The AUC score of **0.8976** indicates a strong ability of the model to distinguish between the two classes. An AUC value closer to 1 suggests that the model is effective in ranking positive instances higher than negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Random Forest model demonstrates robust performance with good accuracy and AUC scores. However, the significant difference in recall and F1-scores between the two classes suggests that additional techniques, such as further hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or alternative resampling methods, may be necessary to enhance the model's ability to identify the minority class (income >50K) effectively.\n",
