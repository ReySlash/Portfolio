    "Customer segmentation is a crucial step in understanding the unique characteristics and behaviors of different groups within a customer base. In this project, clustering was performed using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **KMeans** for grouping customers into clusters. The resulting segmentation aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform targeted strategies and decision-making.\n",

    "This phase focuses on analyzing the clusters to understand their distinct features and distributions. By exploring the characteristics that define each group and differentiate them from others, we aim to:\n",

    "- Interpret the patterns and preferences within each segment.\n",
    "- Highlight differences across clusters to provide actionable insights.\n",
